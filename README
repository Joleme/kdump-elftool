This is kdumptool, a tool for creating usable coredumps from a kernel
crash.

To use this, use the kexec/kdump instructions to get into a crash dump
kernel (the kernel that boots from the crashed kernel).  It will have
/dev/oldmem and /proc/vmcore available.

Run "kdumptool topelf -o pelffile" and copy pelffile to your system
where you will be doing the analysis.

Before doing analysis, run "kdumptool tovelf -i pelffile -o kcore" to
generate the gdb-usable core file.

Then do "gdb vmlinux kcore".  For more information, see:

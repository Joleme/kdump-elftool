This is kdumptool, a tool for creating usable coredumps from a kernel
crash.

You will need to patch your kernel with the patches in
"kernel-patches" before this will work.  These patches add system
memory ranges and the physical address of the kernel page table to the
data passed from the old kernel to the new kernel.  The MIPS-specific
patch is only required for MIPS, obviously, it adds a boatload of
parameters that are required to successfully navigate the page tables.

To use this, use the kexec/kdump instructions to get into a crash dump
kernel (the kernel that boots from the crashed kernel).  It will have
/dev/oldmem and /proc/vmcore available.

Run "kdumptool topelf -o pelffile" and copy pelffile to your system
where you will be doing the analysis.

Before doing analysis, run "kdumptool tovelf -i pelffile -o kcore" to
generate the gdb-usable core file.

Then do "gdb vmlinux kcore".  For more information, see:
